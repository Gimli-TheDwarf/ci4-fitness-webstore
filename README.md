My primary CodeIgniter4 project showcases most of my practical software development skills.
As of now, the project functions essentially as a web store, allowing users to create an account either locally or via Google. 
It also lets them manage a shopping cart, filter and search items, and browse the currently available products.
Furthermore, the project supports administrator privileges, allowing users with the appropriate permissions to add, edit, and remove products, manage tags, and manage registered user accounts.
The project is written in PHP (CodeIgniter 4), with JavaScript, AJAX, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML, and Svelte for reactivity.
